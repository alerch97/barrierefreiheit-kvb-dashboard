# Dashboard - Monitoring accessibility in Cologne's public transport

An streamlit-based web app for people with a disability to monitor the accessibility of tram stations in Cologne.
The app will include information about current breakdowns of elevators and escaltors. Furthermore I will add functional elevators and esclators to check if people with a disability can access / leave the tram station.

Here you can see a little preview of the web app:
